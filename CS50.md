# Week 0: Scratch
1. Introducing the course, course goals
2. Explaining binary
3. bits to bytes
4. encoding, using binary to represent . . .
	1. text: ASCII, Unicode, etc.
	2. color, images, videos
	3. sound
5. abstraction
	1. example: car as abstraction
6. algorithms
	1. example: searching in the phone book
		1. different algorithms, correctness, efficiency
		2. pseudo-code
			1. verbs --> functions
			2. if, else --> conditionals
			3. go back --> loops
7. binary --> high level languages
8. scratch: introduce key concepts through scratch examples
	1. functions
		1. arguments
		2. return values
		3. side effects
	2. conditionals
	3. loops
	4. data types
	5. abstractions

# Week 1: C
1. translate a Scratch program to a C program
2. source code --> compiler --> machine code
3. quality code: correctness, design, style
4. tools
	1. guided tour of VS Code
	2. command line
5. "hello, world" in C
	1. notice syntax highlighting, compare to the different colored blocks in Scratch
	2. compiler error messages
	3. escape sequence for new line
6. libraries
	1. try removing the `stdio` library and see what happens --> intuition about what a library is and what 'including' it means
	2. what is a library and why have libraries
	3. uses manual pages to explore libraries, CS50's simplified manual pages
	4. cs50 header file, principally for input
