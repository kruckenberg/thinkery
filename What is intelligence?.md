# A Practical View of Intelligence
[Stuart Russell]'s _practical_ view of intelligence:
> Roughly speaking, an entity is intelligent to the extent that what it does is likely to achieve what it wants, given what it has perceived. (from **Human Compatible**)

This is roughly equal to Bernoulli's "maximizing utility".
## possible critiques
- A well-adapted but wholly instinctual being would could meet this definition.
- Are all "wants" equally intelligent? Or is intelligence involved in the selection of goals and the formation of desires?
- On this view, is all knowledge *useful* knowledge? Can we truly say that we wish to know things for the sake of knowing them? (Can knowledge itself be an "intelligent" goal?)

## corollaries and extensions
- A link to the evolutionary origin of intelligence: intelligence is an adaptation that speeds up evolution, increasing the likelihood of replication across a wider range of environments.
- We caveat "given what it has perceived" is critical. Intelligent beings have to take into account uncertainty and ignorance. We aim to maximize utility.
