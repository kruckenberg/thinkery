# Goals
1. Perseverance. Code rarely works the first time. Keep trying.
2. Resourcefulness. Search. Read. Ask. You will (often) hit a wall, but solutions and help are out there if you'll make the effort.
3. Humility. 
4. Self-control, self-management (need a more virtue-focused word)

# Requirements
An idea: a menu of projects -- some small, some large. Each has an assigned point value. Students choose from the menu and their grade is the sum of the points they earn.

Each modules combines some scaffolding, step-by-step instructions for some parts, and on-your-own elements.

Keep a log. Every day, students record what they worked on and assess themselves.
