# Goals
1. Perseverance. Code rarely works the first time. Keep trying.
2. Resourcefulness. You will (often) hit walls. Get good at scaling them. Search. Read. Ask. Solutions and help are out there if you make the effort.
3. Spirit of Adventure
4. Hard work
5. Generosity
# Essentials
1. A browser-based coding environment
	1. ideally could handle submissions, grading
	2. Possibilities:
		1. GitHub Classroom -- [overview video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIRjfNq867bewk3ZGV6Z7a16YDNRCpK3u)
		2. Replit -- [overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg4vDnqiz2M)
2. A number of coding problems with starter code and test cases
3. A number of projects with walk-throughs

# Rough Sequence
1. Survey: what do you know and what do you want to know?
2. Introducing the course: an **experiment**, learning Python and building games
3. Hello, world! in Scratch
4. Fundamental concepts in Scratch
	1. functions
		1. arguments
		2. return values
		3. side effects 
	2. conditionals
	3. loops
	4. data types
	5. abstractions
5. Translating these core concepts to Python
6. Getting set up with the course tools
7. First problem set
8. Get familiar with the `turtle` library
9. Experimenting with `turtle` & `turtle` [problems](https://pythonturtle.academy/)
10. Pong!
	1. Basic game mechanics
	2. problem decomposition & pseudo-coding the game
	3. try it!
	4. presenting your game and talking through your code
	5. bonus: refactor
11. Snake
12. Tetris
13. (Space Invaders)
14. Multi-player online game

# Requirements
An idea: a menu of projects -- some small, some large. Each has an assigned point value. Students choose from the menu and their grade is the sum of the points they earn.

Each modules combines some scaffolding, step-by-step instructions for some parts, and on-your-own elements.

Keep a log. Every day, students record what they worked on and assess themselves.
