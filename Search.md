A search problem consists in:
  - state space: the set of possible states the environment can be in
  - initial state: the state in which the agent starts
  - goal state(s): the set of one or more goals states (could be defined by a property that applies to many -- and maybe infinitely many -- states)
  - available actions
  - transition model
  - action cost function

- Any sequence of actions forms a path.
- A solution is any path that reaches a goal state.
- An optimal solution is a solution with the lowest path cost among all possible solutions.
