## To-Do
- [ ] Get acquainted with Scratch
- [ ] See key coding concepts in action:
	- [ ] Variables
	- [ ] Conditionals
	- [ ] Loops
	- [ ] Functions | Abstractions

## Editor Elements
- Canvas
- Sprites
- Code blocks + code blocks menu
	- Most categories are pretty intuitive (motion, looks, sound, etc.)
	- Events: special "triggers" from user or environment and some "messaging"
	- Sensing: ways for the sprite to detect its environment (incl. the time) and some user interactions 
	- Control: waiting, repeating
	- Variables: storing values
	- Operators: arithmetic, comparisons, randomness generator
	- My Blocks: abstractions, functions
