# Essentials
1. A browser-based coding environment
	1. ideally could handle submissions, grading
	2. Possibilities:
		1. GitHub Classroom -- [overview video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIRjfNq867bewk3ZGV6Z7a16YDNRCpK3u)
		2. Replit -- [overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg4vDnqiz2M)
2. A number of coding problems with starter code and test cases
3. A number of projects with walk-throughs


# Requirements
An idea: a menu of projects -- some small, some large. Each has an assigned point value. Students choose from the menu and their grade is the sum of the points they earn.

Each modules combines some scaffolding, step-by-step instructions for some parts, and on-your-own elements.

Keep a log. Every day, students record what they worked on and assess themselves.
