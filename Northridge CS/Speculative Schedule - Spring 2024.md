# Rough Sequence
1. Survey: what do you know and what do you want to know?
2. Introducing the course: an **experiment**, learning Python and building games
3. Hello, world! in Scratch
4. Fundamental concepts in Scratch
	1. functions
		1. arguments
		2. return values
		3. side effects

	4. data types
	5. abstractions
5. Translating these core concepts to Python
6. Getting set up with the course tools

8. Hangman
9. Get familiar with the `turtle` library
10. Experimenting with `turtle` & `turtle` [problems](https://pythonturtle.academy/)
11. Pong!
	1. Basic game mechanics
	2. problem decomposition & pseudo-coding the game
	3. try it!
	4. presenting your game and talking through your code
	5. challenges:

		2. refine:
			1. start game only when players are ready

			3. add boundaries, mid-line, etc
			4. spiff it up
			5. add sound effects
